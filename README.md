# Writing Streak
This Obsidian plugin gamifies the writing process, helps you develop a daily writing habit, and write in the flow.

- Start a "Sprint".
- Green healthbar decays as the time goes on, and refills as you type.
- Blue progressbar shows how much time you have left in the current sprint.
- Keep writing and don't run out of health until the sprint is over.
- Successful sprints are recorded in your sprint log.
